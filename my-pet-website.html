    <h2>The reasons we do not have a pet </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Space constraints</li>
      <li>Time constraints(I'm at Epicodus)</li>
      <li>Allergies</li>
      <li>Money</li>
    </ul>
    <p> For sake of brevity, we will avoid presenting a thesis and subsequent research into the reasons we do not own a pet.
      Instead we will focus on the positive aspects of not owning a pet.
